in this portfolio website there is a contact page. so if someone needs to contact us and send a message they can send a message via this page. then we can see those messages in firebase. 

i have already added piumi herath madam(piyumi@as.rjt.ac.lk) as a viewer on my firebase .(my account- vutzybyinu@gmail.com)
and here is the link for my firebase -->>   https://fir-d5138-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/
